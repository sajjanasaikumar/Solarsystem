    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The solar system is a vast and dynamic celestial neighborhood that includes the Sun and all the objects bound to it by gravity. At its heart is the Sun, a massive, glowing ball of hydrogen and helium that provides the energy necessary for life on Earth. The Sun's gravity keeps the solar system's objects in orbit.</p>
    <p>Surrounding the Sun are eight major planets, which orbit in elliptical paths. These planets are divided into two </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Terrestrial Planets: </b> Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are rocky and have solid surfaces.</li>
    <li><b>Gas Giants and Ice Giants:</b> Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants with thick atmospheres mostly of hydrogen and helium. Uranus and Neptune, known as ice giants, have a larger proportion of "ices" like water, ammonia, and methane.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to the planets, the solar system contains dwarf planets like Pluto, numerous moons orbiting the planets, and various small bodies such as asteroids and comets. The asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, contains many rocky remnants from the early solar system. Beyond Neptune, the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud are home to icy bodies and comets.</p>
    <p>The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust. Over time, the material within this cloud coalesced to form the Sun, planets, and other objects. The study of the solar system helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems and the conditions that might support life.</p>
        
        
        
        <ol>
            <li>
        <a href="mercury.html"><b>Mercury:</b></a>The closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It has a rocky surface and extreme temperature variations between day and night due to its thin atmosphere.
    </li>
    <li>
<a href="venus.html"><b> Venus: </b></a> Often called Earth's twin because of its similar size, Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet. Its surface is obscured by dense clouds of sulfuric acid.
    </li>
<li>
<a href="Earth.html"><b>Earth:</b></a> Our home planet, Earth is the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse range of environments, a breathable atmosphere, and liquid water, which are essential for sustaining life.
</li>
<li>
<a href="mars.html"><b>Mars:</b></a> Known as the Red Planet due to its iron oxide-rich surface, Mars has the tallest volcano and the deepest canyon in the solar system. Scientists are keenly interested in Mars because of its potential to host past or present life.
</li>
<li>
<a href="jupiter.html"><b>Jupiter:</b></a> The largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter is a gas giant with a strong magnetic field and dozens of moons. Its Great Red Spot is a giant storm that's been raging for centuries.
</li>
<li>
<a href="saturn.html"><b>Saturn:</b></a> Famous for its stunning ring system, Saturn is also a gas giant and has a large number of moons. Its rings are made mostly of ice and rock particles.
</li>
<li>
<a href="uranus.html"><b>Uranus:</b></a> This ice giant is unique for its tilted axis, causing extreme seasonal variations. Uranus has a faint ring system and is known for its blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere.
</li>
<li>
<a href="neptune.html"><b>Neptune:</b></a> The farthest planet from the Sun, Neptune is another ice giant with a dynamic atmosphere and strong winds. Its deep blue color is also due to methane, and it has a series of faint rings.
